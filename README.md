**Implement Postfix Expression Evaluation and Exception Handling**

This repository hosts a Java application designed to evaluate postfix expressions, featuring robust error handling through custom exceptions. In addition to its educational and algorithmic applications, this tool is particularly useful in developing calculators or computational software that requires efficient and accurate expression evaluation. The PostfixEvaluator class, utilizing a stack-based approach, is ideal for calculator implementations because it efficiently handles complex mathematical expressions without the need for operator precedence or parentheses, streamlining the calculation process. This makes the application not only a valuable learning resource but also a practical tool for building sophisticated calculators and computational tools in various professional and academic settings.
